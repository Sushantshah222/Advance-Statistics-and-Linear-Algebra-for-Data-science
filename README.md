### **Emperical Formula** 68% - 95% - 99.7% Rule


 - within 1st Standard Deviation, 68% of the data will fall
 - within 2nd Standard Deviation, 95% of data will fall
 - within 3nd Standard Deviation, 99.7% of data will fall



### Methods to find Outliers:

1. calculating **Z-Score**
2. calculating **Inter Quartile Range (IQR)**



## Z-score


Z	=	standard score  </br>
x	=	observed value  </br>
µ	=	mean of the sample  </br>
∑	=	standard deviation of the sample  </br>


## To calculate Inter Quartile Range (IQR):

- Short the dataset
- calculate 1st Quartile and 3rd Quartile
- find **Lower fence = Q1 -1.5(IQR)**
- find **Upper fence = Q3 -1.5(IQR)**
